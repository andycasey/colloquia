**Madhusudhan**: *Big Questions in Exoplanetary Science*

- Planetary diversity: 
  - planetary system architectures; 
  - planetary environments (host stars, disks, satellites); 
  - planetary bulk properties (Mp, Rp, Tp, etc); 
  - planetary processes (atmospheres, interiors, surfaces)
- Planetary systems are extremely diverse in all aspects of orbital architectures (orbital eccentricities, obliquities, period ratios, multiplicity, compactness, demographics, and just *strangeness*) [Winn & Fabrycky 2015; Winn 2010]
- Most exoplanets are within the orbit of Mercury: you could have 6 planets within the orbit of Mercury
- Numerous detections of protoplanetary disks, debris disks, exozodiacal dust, and polluted white dwarfs â€” this shows diersity in planetary environments during and after formation
- Big questions on planetary architecture:
  - How unique is the architecure of the Solar system?
  - What is \n_earth?
  - What is the true occurence rate of giant exoplanets?
    - Transit and RV demographics are period limited
    - Direct imaging surveys have not detected many giants
  - What is the influence of outer giant planets and disks on smaller inner planets and vice-versa?
  - How do planets interact with their environments?
  - How common are exomoons and rings?
- Exoplanetary properties [Biechman]
  - Planet masses are almost continuous: if you take mass as a metric, planets are extremely diverse
  - Transit and RV surveys show that low-mass "rocky" planets are extremely common (most dominant planet type; Fressin et al. (2013))
  - Fe vaporises at 3,000 K
  - **How diverse are exoplanetary atmospheres and interiors?**
- Big questions on the diversity of exoplanetary atmospheres:
  - Chemical compositions (abundances, C/O ratios, etc)
  - Equilibrium and non-equilibrium chemical processes
  - Temperature structures, stratospheres, etc
  - Aerosols: Clouds, hazes, condensates
  - Atmospheric circulation
  - Exospheres and atmospheric escape
  - Geophysical and biological feedback
